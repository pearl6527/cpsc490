        As access to information becomes increasingly digital, the role of public libraries in our society has shifted. 
        Just as the rest of us adapt to advances in technology and trends in society, so have libraries adapted their 
        function and services to better serve their communities, for example increasing the variety in the format of 
        their materials to include digital items such as ebooks, audio, and video. This project aims to examine and 
        present the societal impact of public library systems in the United States through data visualization 
        techniques. The visualizations created in the course of this project are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        in particular the JavaScript library <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, as well as <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">
        Plotly</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. In addition to visualizing statistics 
        specific to public libraries and public library systems such as circulation volume, population served, and size 
        of holdings, this project also explores library statistics in conjunction with census and demographic data such 
        as rate of poverty and education attainment. In particular, my visualizations focus on: 1) How has the role of 
        public libraries changed throughout the years? 2) How does public libraries service and use relate to poverty and 
        educational attainment? And 3) How can I design interactive visualizations that are intuitive and informative, and 
        which will allow the user to easily explore and compare statistics of personal interest? The main sources of data 
        are the Public Libraries Survey datasets collected by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as well as 
        poverty and education data from the U.S. Census.
