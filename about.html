      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        As access to information becomes increasingly digital, the role of public libraries in our society has shifted. 
        Just as the rest of us adapt to advances in technology and trends in society, so have libraries adapted their 
        function and services to better serve their communities, for example increasing the variety in the format of 
        their materials to include digital items such as ebooks, audio, and video. This project aims to examine and 
        present the societal impact of public library systems in the United States through data visualization 
        techniques. The visualizations created in the course of this project are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        in particular the JavaScript library <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, as well as <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">
        Plotly</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. In addition to visualizing statistics 
        specific to public libraries and public library systems such as circulation volume, population served, and size 
        of holdings, this project also explores library statistics in conjunction with census and demographic data such 
        as rate of poverty and education attainment.

      <h2>Background & Motivations</h2>
      <p><em>
        There aren’t many truly public places left in America. Most of our shared spaces require money or a certain social 
        status to access. Malls exist to sell people things. Museums discourage loiterers. Coffee shops expect patrons to 
        purchase a drink or snack if they want to enjoy the premises.<br>

        Public libraries form the backdrop of many fond memories for me, and they’re one of my favorite places to be. 
        Whenever I have to stay somewhere for longer than a few days, I find myself either within or looking for its 
        public libraries: New York, NY; Baltimore County, MD; New Haven, CT; Seattle, WA; King County, WA…
      </p>
      <p>
        And it’s not just about the books (and audiobooks, DVDs, even video games), although they are wonderful. The 
        services public libraries provide extend far beyond the multitude of materials they manage and lend out; public 
        libraries provide its patrons with services such as internet and computer access, study spaces, programs, classes, 
        and clubs for people of all age groups and a variety of interests, homework help and online tutoring, college prep 
        services, job-hunting assistance and assistance with other social services, cultural events, access to online 
        resources like databases and streaming services, information about community engagement, etc. The list can go on.

        In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/opinion/sunday/civil-society-library.html">an 2018 op-ed in the 
        <em>New York Times</em></a>, sociologist Eric Klinenberg describes public libraries as <em>social infrastructure</em>, 
        “physical places and organizations that shape the way people interact.” Moreover, existing in a time when the 
        explosion of information online can often be confusing and overwhelming, libraries and librarians are still among 
        the top sources of information trusted by Americans, according to 
        <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/30/most-americans-especially-millennials-say-libraries-can-help-them-find-reliable-trustworthy-information/">a 2016 study by the Pew Research Center</a>.

        As such, I am interested in exploring the role that public libraries have played in the U.S., and looking at any 
        trends that may exist. In particular, my visualizations focus on: 1) How has the role of public libraries changed 
        throughout the years? 2) How does public libraries service and use relate to poverty and educational attainment? 
        And 3) How can I design interactive visualizations that are intuitive and informative, and which will allow the 
        user to easily explore and compare statistics of personal interest?
