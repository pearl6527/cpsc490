## Abstract
As access to information becomes increasingly digital, the role of public libraries in our society has shifted. Just as the rest of us adapt to advances in technology and trends in society, so have libraries adapted their function and services to better serve their communities, for example increasing the variety in the format of their materials to include digital items such as ebooks, audio, and video. This project aims to examine and present the societal impact of public library systems in the United States through data visualization techniques. The visualizations created in the course of this project are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in particular the JavaScript library [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), as well as [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/). In addition to visualizing statistics specific to public libraries and public library systems such as circulation volume, population served, and size of holdings, this project also explores library statistics in conjunction with census and demographic data such as rate of poverty and education attainment.
